# Design Patterns
Examples of the [Design Patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern) in C++

## Creational
| Pattern | Description | Source Code |
| :--- | :--- | :---: |
|[Abstract Factory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_factory_pattern)|Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.|[C++](Creational/Abstract-factory) [Delphi](Creational/Abstract-factory/Delphi)|
|[Factory Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_method_pattern)|Define an interface for creating a single object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate.|[C++](Creational/Factory-method) |
|[Singleton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_patternn)|Ensure a class has only one instance, and provide a global point of access to it.|[C++](Creational/Singleton) [Delphi](Creational/Singleton/Delphi) |

## Behavioral
| Pattern | Description | Source Code |
| :--- | :--- | :---: |
|[Observer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern)|Define a one-to-many dependency between objects where a state change in one object results in all its dependents being notified and updated automatically.|[C++](Behavioral/Observer)|
|[Strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_pattern)|Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable.|[C++](Behavioral/Strategy)|

## Structural
| Pattern | Description | Source Code |
| :--- | :--- | :---: |
|[Decorator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorator_pattern)|Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically keeping the same interface.|[C++](Structural/Decorator)|
